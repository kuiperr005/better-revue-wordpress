== Description ==

This plug-in easily allows you to integrate Revue subscriptions forms within pages or display them as a widget.

Installation is pretty straight forward.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/revue` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

1. Retrieve your API key from [https://www.getrevue.co/app/integrations](https://www.getrevue.co/app/integrations)
